# For AI agents working on this repo (cloud Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes)

Read this first. It says what runs where, so you don't redo or fight the Mac side.

## Two halves, one backlog
- **Mac (owner's laptop, runs while it is on):** `~/code/awesome-indian-exams` is a clone of a LOCAL bare repo
  `~/.hive/hub.git`. `awesome-indian-exams/ops/hive-loop.sh` runs Hermes (Muse 1.3 free), OpenCode (OpenCode Go,
  DeepSeek V4.1 Flash) and HTTP free-agent workers. They claim tasks and push `agent/*` branches to the LOCAL
  repo; `~/.hive/judge-loop.sh` runs `ops/judge.py --publish` locally. Config: `~/.hive/agents.env`.
- **GitHub (this repo):** receives ONE gated, batched commit per hour from `~/.hive/publish-github.sh`
  (validate --strict, unit tests, gitleaks, path/PII deny-list). Commits you land on `main` here are merged back
  into the Mac hub by the same script before it publishes, so the two halves stay in sync.

## Rules that are not negotiable
- **Never use git as a message bus.** No claim refs, heartbeat commits or per-task pushes to GitHub, and no
  schedule on `hive-cloud.yml`. The owner's previous GitHub account was flagged as spam for exactly that. The
  global pre-push guard allows ≤20 pushes/day/repo.
- **Only real, sourced content.** Link to official sources; never copy coaching material, lecture transcripts or
  topper copies; never invent numbers or dates. Unverified stays marked unverified.
- Keep the guardrail files (gates, judge, runner, agentctl, harvest, doctor, workflows) intact; propose changes in
  a PR with tests.

## How a cloud session helps best
Work in a branch and open a PR here (content pages, registry, modules, tooling with tests). The hourly Mac sync
pulls `main`. Tasks that need the owner's disk or logins are `where = "mac"` in `ops/tasks.toml`; leave those to
the Mac. The cloud session cannot see the Mac; everything it needs to know is in this file and `ops/HIVE.md`.
