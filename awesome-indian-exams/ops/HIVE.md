# The hive: how JEVX, Hermes and OpenCode run this repo without the owner

Three agent roles work **in parallel**, stay in sync through git alone, and publish every hour. The owner only
logs in and pays for anything that isn't free. By default nothing needs paying for: see
[`docs/FREE-COMPUTE.md`](../docs/FREE-COMPUTE.md).

| Role | Lane | Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Hermes** | research + content | writes and verifies exam pages, modules, registry entries from official documents |
| **OpenCode** | tooling | extends the content gate, formats, tests |
| **JEVX** | planner + judge | reviews every change, publishes what passes, keeps the backlog fed |
| owner | human | `H-` tasks only: login, payment, repository settings |

## Two ways to run, same rules

**Mac (where the hive runs):** the owner's Mac runs every lane continuously
([`hive-loop.sh`](hive-loop.sh), set up by [`mac-bootstrap.sh`](mac-bootstrap.sh)): the real Hermes and OpenCode,
Command Code (GOAT plan), Gemini CLI and Antigravity when signed in, plus workers on the built-in zero-cost agent ([`free_agent.py`](free_agent.py)).
They claim tasks and push `agent/*` branches to a **local** bare repository (`~/.hive/hub.git`), and the JEVX
judge ([`judge.py`](judge.py)) runs every code gate and an LLM review there. Once an hour, `~/.hive/publish-github.sh`
publishes **one** gated, batched commit (validate, tests, secret and path checks) to GitHub, and merges anything
that landed on GitHub's `main` back into the local hub.

On the Mac the runner sets `HIVE_OPEN_PR=0`: the JEVX planner lane skips every `gh`/PR step and pushes its plan
branch `agent/jevx/plan-<ts>` with the `Hive-Publish: judge` trailer, exactly like a worker branch, for
[`judge.py`](judge.py) to land onto `main`. Its lane scope is `ops/tasks.toml`, `ops/plan/`, `README.md`,
`UPDATES.md`, `resources/all-exams.md` and `resources/overlap-map.md`. With `HIVE_OPEN_PR=1` (cloud) it opens a
pull request instead.

**Never use git as a message bus.** Claim refs, heartbeat commits or per-task pushes to GitHub every few minutes
look like spam; the owner's previous GitHub account was flagged for exactly that.

**Cloud (by hand only):** `.github/workflows/hive-cloud.yml` (repository root) runs the same lanes on GitHub
Actions when started from the Actions tab, for example while the Mac is off. It has no schedule, on purpose.
Kill switch: set the repository variable `HIVE_ENABLED` to `false`.

Both modes use the same atomic claims, so no two workers take the same task.

```

            │ claim → agent edits → content gate │   │ same steps, own lane   │   (parallel, own worktrees)
            │ → receipt (code) → lane + evidence │   │                        │

            └──────────────────┬─────────────────┘   └───────────┬────────────┘
                               ▼                                 ▼
            JEVX judge: main's own gates + main's self-tests on the branch + evidence + LLM verdict
                               ▼
               approved → squash onto main → index, overlap map and UPDATES.md regenerated
```

## Focus: starts at 20%, grows as it matures

[`hive.toml`](hive.toml) `[focus.ramp]`: the "india" focus (every exam family except the engineering track)
starts at **20%** of runs and gains **1 point for every 5 india tasks published**, as long as at least 80% of
judged india work was approved. If quality drops, it falls back to 20% until it recovers. It is capped at 60%, so
the engineering track always keeps at least 40%. The share is computed from receipts and judge logs on `main`, so
the cloud and the Mac always agree. Hours are assigned with a golden-ratio sequence, so any stretch of hours
matches the share. If the preferred focus has no ready task, the lane takes one from the other focus rather than
idling. `agentctl.py status` prints the current share.

## Workers: many agents per lane

`run-hourly.sh <lane> [worker]`: several agents can serve one lane in parallel, each with its own worktree, lock
and log. On the Mac the Hermes lane has three workers (Hermes `hermes -z`, Gemini CLI `gemini --yolo -p`,
Antigravity `agy -p` behind a pseudo-terminal), and the OpenCode lane runs `opencode run` on the OpenCode Go plan
(DeepSeek V4.1 Flash). Command Code (GOAT plan) runs as its own workers, `commandcode-1..N` in the Hermes lane
by default, through [`commandcode.sh`](commandcode.sh): a headless `command-code -p` run that exits 75 (back off,
task back to the queue) when credits or rate limits run out. A worker that fails without changing anything retries once on the free agent
(`HIVE_FALLBACK`), so one logged-out tool never stalls a lane. Tasks marked `where = "mac"` (they need local files)
run only on the Mac.

## Continuous mode (use the whole machine)

[`hive-loop.sh`](hive-loop.sh) `start|stop|status` runs many workers per lane back-to-back instead of hourly: by
default 6 Hermes-lane and 6 OpenCode-lane workers, 6 Command Code workers when `HIVE_CMD_COMMANDCODE` is set
(`HIVE_LOOP_COMMANDCODE`, lane `HIVE_COMMANDCODE_LANE`), plus Gemini and Antigravity when installed, and a JEVX
review/merge loop every 30 minutes. It keeps the Mac awake and backs off when there is no ready task or no LLM
capacity. `stop` ends only the process groups it started. A manual cloud run uses a 6 + 6 job
matrix. Tested: parallel loops took every task exactly once and left no processes after
`stop`.

## Sandbox (cloud)

In the cloud, agents that have a shell (the real OpenCode CLI) work on a copy of the content folder with no
`.git` and no GitHub token. The runner copies their file changes back, and every gate still applies, so an agent
can never push or publish by itself.

## Harvest: the owner's earlier work

[`harvest.py`](harvest.py) scans the Mac (Documents, Desktop, Downloads, code folders), every Google Drive for
desktop account, iCloud and `~/Hive-Inbox` (Google Takeout exports). It builds a **private** inventory in
`~/.hive/harvest/`, drops duplicates, and flags transcripts, coaching material and personal data. Only the
owner's own, non-personal work becomes tasks (`T-5xx`, `where = "mac"`), which name nothing but an opaque
`inv:` id. Hermes-lane workers read items through the MCP tools `harvest_search` / `harvest_item`, keep the
structure and advice, and re-verify every fact officially (skill `harvest-import`).

## Self-healing

[`doctor.py`](doctor.py) checks the content gate, the backlog per lane and focus, quality, stale claims and, on
the Mac, every tool, login, the schedule, each worker's last run and errors, and the harvest. JEVX reads it every
hour: a tooling problem becomes an OpenCode task; a login, payment or settings click becomes an `H-` task that
links the exact page in [`docs/OWNER-CLICKS.md`](../docs/OWNER-CLICKS.md).

## Sync protocol (all state is on the remote)

| State | Where | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| backlog | `ops/tasks.toml` on `main` | JEVX only |
| claimed | `refs/heads/claim/<id>` or branch `agent/<lane>/<id>` | `agentctl.py next --claim` (atomic create-only push) |
| done | `ops/done/<id>.md` on `main` | the runner writes it; it counts once published |
| plan / judge log | `ops/plan/<date>.md` | JEVX |

Acceptance criteria in receipts are copied from the task definition; they are not individually ticked review results.
Older receipts display these static criteria with unchecked `[ ]` marks, which do not mean review is pending or that
a criterion was skipped. The judge's publish verdict is recorded separately in the dated plan; detailed judge logs
are local and may not be available in the public repository.

- Two agents can never hold the same task: a claim is a push that only succeeds if the ref doesn't exist yet
  (stress-tested with 12 parallel agents and 80 tasks, each taken exactly once).
- A claim with no work branch for 6 hours is freed, so a crashed agent never blocks a task. A run that finds no
  free LLM capacity frees its task immediately.
- Workers never touch generated files, so parallel changes don't conflict.

## Trust model: what stops a bad change

1. **Receipts are written by code.** The runner records the diff, the real content-gate output and every URL the
   agent fetched (status, size, SHA-256). Agent notes are quoted separately, labelled as claims, and can't pose
   as code sections.
2. **Evidence gate.** A page becomes `official` only with a recorded HTTP 200 fetch, from an allowlisted
   official domain, of a URL listed on the page, within a day of `last_verified`.
3. **Lane scope.** Each lane may only change its own files ([`scripts/hive_gate.py`](../scripts/hive_gate.py)).
4. **Guardrails are protected.** No agent may change the gates, judge, runner, claim tool, free agent,
   prompts, skills, domain allowlist, `hive.toml` or `.github/`. Only the owner can.
5. **The judge uses main's gates, not the branch's**, and runs main's self-tests against the branch's code. A
   change that loosens an existing check fails a test main already has.
6. **LLM review** on top, for what code can't judge: usefulness, honesty, copied text.
7. **Content gate** everywhere: official sources only, no file-dump links, no broken links, required sections.

## Agent tooling

- **MCP server** ([`mcp_server.py`](mcp_server.py), stdio): `hive_status`, `next_task`, `validate_content`,
  `check_lane_scope`, `list_exams`, `exam_info`, `fetch_url` (records evidence to `$HIVE_FETCH_LOG`),
  `read_skill`. OpenCode picks it up from [`opencode.json`](../opencode.json). For Hermes, JEVX or any other
  MCP client, register the stdio command `python3 <repo>/awesome-indian-exams/ops/mcp_server.py`.
- **Skills** ([`.agents/skills/`](../.agents/skills/)): `exam-page`, `module-page`, `hive-tooling`,
  `review-agent-work`, `hive-sync`, in the standard `SKILL.md` format. OpenCode loads `.agents/skills`
  natively, and the runner also puts the lane's skill into every prompt.

## Tested

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` includes:
- an offline **dry run** of the whole cloud loop (claim → free agent edits → gates → receipt → branch → judge →
  published on `main`), with a scripted local LLM;
- a **negative dry run**: an agent marking a page official without evidence is stopped before publishing;
- a **stress test** of parallel claims (`HIVE_STRESS_WORKERS=12 HIVE_STRESS_TASKS=80` for a heavier run);
- an MCP protocol test, provider fallback on HTTP 429, and scope refusal for every guardrail.
